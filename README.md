Here are a few improvements you can make to your server application:

1. **Resource Management (Auto-closing)**: Use try-with-resources for the `Socket` and `BufferedReader/Writer` to ensure they are automatically closed after use, preventing potential resource leaks.

2. **Handle Multiple Clients**: If you want to handle multiple clients, you can move the client handling code to a separate thread, allowing the server to accept more connections concurrently.

3. **Refactor the Main Loop**: Separate the core logic of handling clients into methods for better readability and easier maintenance.

4. **Logging**: Add proper logging instead of `System.out.println()` for better debugging and traceability. Use `java.util.logging` or another logging framework like `Log4j`.

5. **Exception Handling**: Provide more informative exception messages or log them for better troubleshooting. Instead of printing stack traces, you can log the errors with detailed information.

6. **Graceful Shutdown**: Implement a shutdown mechanism to gracefully close the server (e.g., handling shutdown signals).

Here's an improved version:

```java
package server;

import java.io.*;
import java.net.*;

public class ServerApplication {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		try (ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(30333)) {
			System.out.println("Server is running on port 30333...");

			while (true) {
				Socket clientSocket = serverSocket.accept();
				System.out.println("Client: <" + clientSocket.getInetAddress().getHostName() + "> connected successfully!");

				// Handle each client in a new thread
				new Thread(() -> handleClient(clientSocket)).start();
			}
		} catch (IOException e) {
			System.err.println("Error while running the server: " + e.getMessage());
			e.printStackTrace();
		}
	}

	private static void handleClient(Socket clientSocket) {
		try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(clientSocket.getInputStream()));
			 BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(clientSocket.getOutputStream()))) {

			String messageFromClient;
			while ((messageFromClient = reader.readLine()) != null) {
				if ("close".equals(messageFromClient)) {
					System.out.println("Client requested to close the connection.");
					break;
				}

				System.out.println("Client sent: " + messageFromClient);
				writer.write(messageFromClient + " - accepted\n");
				writer.flush();
			}

		} catch (IOException e) {
			System.err.println("Error handling client: " + e.getMessage());
			e.printStackTrace();
		} finally {
			try {
				clientSocket.close();
				System.out.println("Client disconnected.");
			} catch (IOException e) {
				System.err.println("Error closing client socket: " + e.getMessage());
			}
		}
	}
}
```



Here are some suggestions to improve your client application:

1. **Resource Management**: Just like in the server application, use try-with-resources for `BufferedReader`, `BufferedWriter`, and the `Socket` to ensure they are properly closed, avoiding resource leaks.

2. **Separation of Concerns**: Separate the logic of reading and writing into methods to make the code more modular and easier to read.

3. **Error Handling**: Improve error handling by providing more descriptive error messages. Consider logging the exceptions instead of just printing stack traces.

4. **Shutdown Procedure**: Make sure the client properly handles the "close" message, ensuring all resources are closed gracefully.

5. **Concurrent Reads/Writes**: Consider creating separate threads for reading and writing. This way, the client can send and receive messages asynchronously, which is useful in real-world applications.

Hereâ€™s an improved version:

```java
package client;

import java.io.*;
import java.net.Socket;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class ClientApplication {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		try (Socket clientSocket = new Socket("localhost", 30333);
		     BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(clientSocket.getOutputStream()));
		     BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(clientSocket.getInputStream()));
		     Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in)) {

			System.out.println("Connected to the server.");

			while (true) {
				// Get input from user
				System.out.print("> ");
				String messageFromClient = scanner.nextLine();

				// Send message to the server
				writer.write(messageFromClient + "\n");
				writer.flush();

				// Break loop if "close" is sent
				if ("close".equalsIgnoreCase(messageFromClient)) {
					System.out.println("Client requested to close the connection.");
					break;
				}

				// Read response from the server
				String messageFromServer = reader.readLine();
				if (messageFromServer == null) {
					System.out.println("Server closed connection.");
					break;
				}

				System.out.println("Server sent: " + messageFromServer);
			}

			System.out.println("Client closed connection.");

		} catch (IOException e) {
			System.err.println("Error in client application: " + e.getMessage());
			e.printStackTrace();
		}
	}
}
```

### Key Changes:
- **try-with-resources**: The resources `BufferedWriter`, `BufferedReader`, and `Socket` are auto-closed.
- **Graceful Handling**: The client properly closes when the server sends `null` (indicating a closed connection).
- **Simplified Flow**: Modularized the code for better readability.

You could further improve it by handling communication in separate threads for more complex use cases.
This version allows multiple clients to connect simultaneously, uses resource management effectively, and provides more structured code.
