Here are a few improvements you can make to your server application:

1. **Resource Management (Auto-closing)**: Use try-with-resources for the `Socket` and `BufferedReader/Writer` to ensure they are automatically closed after use, preventing potential resource leaks.

2. **Handle Multiple Clients**: If you want to handle multiple clients, you can move the client handling code to a separate thread, allowing the server to accept more connections concurrently.

3. **Refactor the Main Loop**: Separate the core logic of handling clients into methods for better readability and easier maintenance.

4. **Logging**: Add proper logging instead of `System.out.println()` for better debugging and traceability. Use `java.util.logging` or another logging framework like `Log4j`.

5. **Exception Handling**: Provide more informative exception messages or log them for better troubleshooting. Instead of printing stack traces, you can log the errors with detailed information.

6. **Graceful Shutdown**: Implement a shutdown mechanism to gracefully close the server (e.g., handling shutdown signals).

Here's an improved version:

```java
package server;

import java.io.*;
import java.net.*;

public class ServerApplication {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		try (ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(30333)) {
			System.out.println("Server is running on port 30333...");

			while (true) {
				Socket clientSocket = serverSocket.accept();
				System.out.println("Client: <" + clientSocket.getInetAddress().getHostName() + "> connected successfully!");

				// Handle each client in a new thread
				new Thread(() -> handleClient(clientSocket)).start();
			}
		} catch (IOException e) {
			System.err.println("Error while running the server: " + e.getMessage());
			e.printStackTrace();
		}
	}

	private static void handleClient(Socket clientSocket) {
		try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(clientSocket.getInputStream()));
			 BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(clientSocket.getOutputStream()))) {

			String messageFromClient;
			while ((messageFromClient = reader.readLine()) != null) {
				if ("close".equals(messageFromClient)) {
					System.out.println("Client requested to close the connection.");
					break;
				}

				System.out.println("Client sent: " + messageFromClient);
				writer.write(messageFromClient + " - accepted\n");
				writer.flush();
			}

		} catch (IOException e) {
			System.err.println("Error handling client: " + e.getMessage());
			e.printStackTrace();
		} finally {
			try {
				clientSocket.close();
				System.out.println("Client disconnected.");
			} catch (IOException e) {
				System.err.println("Error closing client socket: " + e.getMessage());
			}
		}
	}
}
```

This version allows multiple clients to connect simultaneously, uses resource management effectively, and provides more structured code.
